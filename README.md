# Business Operations Analysis

# Project description
The goal of this project was to investigate the company’s operations to develop an integrated data visualisation and a dynamic analytics system to monitor key trends over time and to create a commercial action plan for business growth.

# Business questions
•	Identify areas where existing processes could be improved and cost can be reduced across sales, marketing and supply chain units.

•	Based on the products that are historically purchased together, identify which products can be shelved together in stores or when advertised online.

# Data transformation
The dataset was uploaded to SQL and queries were written to answer the business questions. Power query editor was used to transform the data and ensure they are in the right format. It was then loaded on to Power BI uncover patterns and trends and identify KPIs after which visualisations were created.

# Key findings and recommendations
In the reseller channel, the total product cost of bikes were higher than revenue. It was recommended that they review pricing policy and be more cost efficient in sourcing for materials and labour without impacting product quality. 

Average rejected quantity of purchased items from vendors is 22.94% of average order quantity and the top ten vendors their items were being rejected were identified. It was recommended that they liaise with the vendors to tackle the issue or seek out alternative vendors that would deliver quality materials and in a timely manner.

It was discovered that there was a decline in store sales due to a shift in the market place toward online sales. Accessories was discovered to be the product category and Australia the region driving the decline in sales. Australia was also found to be the region with the highest volume of online accessories sales and so it was recommended that the sales of accessories in that region be migrated fully online. 

Top 10 products that are historically purchased together were identified and recommended that they be shelved and advertised together to increase sales by at least 23%.
